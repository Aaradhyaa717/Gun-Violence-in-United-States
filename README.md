# Gun-Violence-in-United-States

The United States has a well-documented issue with gun violence. In the year 2023 alone 16,500 people have been killed over 1200 of them being teens and over 250 being children ages 0-11.
In this project, we aim to understand these indiscriminate acts of violence. To tackle this problem we downloaded every instance of gun violence from 2014-2018 from a Kaggle 
dataset sourced from the gun violence. Each instance was grouped by its congressional district to see the total numbers of the region as a whole. 

We then merged other data sets specifically, gun ownership rates in each state, population density, median income, and political voting history of each district to create linear regression models that look at past instances
of gun violence and predict future areas at risk.
